I have tried to put the rules in the order of preference.
1. Vote should be counted correctly and displayed.
2. Vote goes to correct person.
3. Vote counting done properly without any bias.
4. Anonymity of voters.
5. Voter can vote only once.
6. No new contestant can be added in between the elections.
