Consists of two Units – a Control Unit and a Balloting Unit – joined by a five-meter cable. 
Control Unit with the Presiding Officer or a Polling Officer.
Balloting Unit  inside the voting compartment. 
Simultaneous button pressing by Polling Officer on Control Unit and voter on Balloting Unit.

Run on an ordinary 6 volt alkaline battery.

Maximum capacity =  3840 votes, approx. total number of electors = 1500

Max 64 candidates
16 candidates per Balloting Unit
Parallel linking of balloting units (16 + 16 + 16 + 16 )
If candidate > 64:
Paper box method

Malfunction situation:
Officer is put on duty to cover about 10 polling stations - carries spare EVMs
Votes recorded until failure in memory of Control Unit

Election Commission + two Public Sector undertakings:
Bharat Electronics Ltd., Bangalore
Electronic Corporation of India Ltd., Hyderabad 

5500/EVM in 1989-90, claim - initial investment neutralised by savings from paper method

Booth capturing - Can be forcibly taken away or damaged.
EVM maximum rate = 5 votes/minute.
Polling Officers can press the "close" button - not possible to record any further vote.
 
Advantages (Claimed)
Cost saving from compared to paper system.
Quick Counting
No invalid votes
Faster Voting process

Count votes EVM wise or feed to a Master Counting machine.

Can store result in memory for more than 10 years.

Memory in the microchip intact without battery - recount shows the result stored in microchip.

Audio(beep) and visual(bulb colour) indications to assure voter.

Microchip sealed at time of import, cannot be opened and program be rewritten without damaging chip.

Room free from dust dampness and rodents.

Each Control Unit has a unique ID Number - painted on each unit with permanent marker.

Initial checking
Presiding Officer demonstrates to polling agents no hidden votes already recorded - press result button. 
Conduct a mock poll - ask the polling agents to record their votes - show result to satisfy. Then clear result

Model M2 produced in 2006-2012 - message from BU to CU in encrypted form
No other kind of data can be accepted
Manufactured in different years - manufacturers don’t know which candidates would contest.
Once ballot key pressed in CU, other keys become inactive till completion of voting process
After the enabling of ballot in CU, only the ‘first key press’is sensed and accepted by CU
“sequenced key presses” signal - not possible 
Model M3 EVM produced after 2013 have features - Tamper Detection and Self Diagnostics
Technological features
One time programmable microcontrollers
Dynamic coding of key codes
Date and time stamping of each and every key press
Encryption technology 
EVM-tracking software 
Tamper detection and self-diagnostics

Programme converted into machine code and given to the chip manufacturer abroad.

Rules for EVM Challenge

LINK 4 - EVM Challenge - ( IMPORTANT ) https://www.huffingtonpost.in/ankit-lal/dear-election-commission-here-s-why-your-evm-hackathon-is-a-j_a_22108571/

Paper - locally available, easily recyclable while 
Electronic circuit storage, maintenance, transport, disposal - huge challenge. 

People required to manage paper ballots vs EVMs.

VVPAT rolled back and count in a automatic way, compare with CU results - IITD prof suggestion - acc to author asked to leave.

According to the RTI report - the "master trainers"(responsible for maintenance of EVM) hire a team of around 20 local electricians under them who work as maintenance staff.

EC admitted to our party functionaries in a meeting that anywhere between 2-5% EVM's malfunction.

Problems with the rules set by EC
